# Deploying with Python

These instructions install Keystone-API directly onto a machine and manage resulting services using the systemd service manager.
It is assumed you have administrative privileges and are managing system services via systemd.
It is also assumed you are installing applications under a dedicated, unprivileged user account called `keystone`. 

## Installing the API

The `keystone_api` package can be installed using the `pip` or `pipx` package managers.

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install keystone-api
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install --include-deps keystone-api
    ```

If you intend to authenticate users via LDAP credentials, you will need to manually specify LDAP support in the install command.
This will require the LDAP development binaries to be available on the host machine.

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install keystone-api[ldap]
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install --include-deps keystone-api[ldap]
    ```

If the installation was successful, the packaged CLI tool will be available in your working environment.
Use the `--help` option to view the available commands.

```bash
keystone-api --help
```

The `keystone-api` utility does not support tab autocompletion by default.
To enable autocomplete for the Bash shell, use the `enable_autocomplete` command.

```bash
keystone-api enable_autocomplete
```

## Deploying Dependencies

Keystone-API requires several backend services to support its operation.
Specific instructions are provided below on configuring each dependency.

### Redis

Most Redis server instances will work out of the box so long as the connection and authentication values are set correctly in the API settings.

### PostgreSQL

Using PostgreSQL for the application database is strongly recommended.
After deploying a PostgreSQL server, you will need to create a dedicated database and user account. 
Start by launching a new SQL session with admin permissions.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Next, create a database and a Keystone service account.
Make sure to replace the password field with a secure value.

```postgresql
create database keystone;
create user keystone_sa with encrypted password '[PASSWORD]';
grant all privileges on database keystone to keystone_sa;
```

### Celery

Celery and Celery Beat are both included when installing the `keystone_api` package.
Both applications should be launched using `keystone_api.apps.scheduler` as the target application.

```bash
celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler worker
celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

The `celery` command executes as a foreground process by default.
The following unit files are provided as a starting point to daemonize the process via the systemd service manager.

=== "keystone-worker.service"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Celery workers for Keystone
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=celery
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi start w1 -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler'
    ExecStop=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi stopwait w1'
    ExecReload=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery multi restart w1'
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

=== "keystone-beat.service"
    
    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Celery Beat scheduler for keystone
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=beat
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/keystone/.local/bin/celery -A keystone_api.apps.scheduler beat --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler'
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

## Deploying the Application

Before launching the API, migrate the database to the latest schema version and collect any static files.
See the [Settings](settings.md) page for details on configuring database credentials and the static files location.

```bash
keystone-api migrate
keystone-api collectstatic
```

Gunicorn is the recommended webserver for running the Keystone-API.
When launching the webserver, use the WSGI entrypoint located under `keystone_api.main.wsgi:application`.

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 keystone_api.main.wsgi:application
```

The `gunicorn` command executes as a foreground process by default.
The following unit files are provided as a starting point to daemonize the process via the systemd service manager.

=== "keystone-server.service"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn server daemon for Keystone
    Requires=keystone-server.socket
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=notify
    User=keystone
    Group=keystone
    RuntimeDirectory=gunicorn
    WorkingDirectory=/home/keystone
    EnvironmentFile=/home/keystone/keystone.env
    ExecStart=/home/keystone/.local/bin/gunicorn keystone_api.main.wsgi
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
    KillMode=mixed
    TimeoutStopSec=5
    PrivateTmp=true
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

=== "keystone-server.socket"

    ```toml
    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn socket for Keystone
    
    [Socket]
    ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock
    SocketUser=nginx
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=sockets.target
    ```

## Upgrading Application Versions

When upgrading the application, ensure the database and static files are up-to-date before relaunching the application server.

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    systemcl stop keystone-server
    systemcl stop keystone-beat
    systemcl stop keystone-worker
    
    pip install --upgrade keystone-api
    keystone-api migrate
    keystone-api collectstatic
    
    systemcl start keystone-worker
    systemcl start keystone-beat
    systemcl start keystone-server
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    systemcl stop keystone-server
    systemcl stop keystone-beat
    systemcl stop keystone-worker
    
    pipx upgrade keystone-api
    keystone-api migrate
    keystone-api collectstatic
    
    systemcl start keystone-worker
    systemcl start keystone-beat
    systemcl start keystone-server
    ```
